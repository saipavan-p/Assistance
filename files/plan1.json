It is important to look at the Drug List (Advanced Control Plan - Aetna Formulary) to understand which\ndrugs are covered.\n*How out-of-network care is reimbursed:\nWe cover the cost of services based on whether doctors are \u201cin network\u201d or \u201cout of network.\u201d We want to help members\nunderstand how much Aetna pays for their out-of-network care. At the same time, we want to make it clear how much more\nmembers will need to pay for this \"out-of-network\" care.\nMembers may choose a provider (doctor or hospital) in our network. Members may choose to visit an out-of-network provider. If a\nmember chooses a doctor who is out of network, their Aetna health plan may pay some of that doctor's bill. Most of the time,\nmembers will pay a lot more money out of their own pocket if they choose to use an out-of-network doctor or hospital.\nVersion: 08/09/2022 [ TPID: 30012759]\nPage 5\n",
        "AFA CPOSII 1600 HSA 100-50 CY V22 (1_1_23)\nAetna Choice\u00ae POS II (Open Access)\nPLAN DESIGN & BENEFITS\nADMINISTERED BY AETNA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY\nWhen members choose out-of-network care, Aetna limits the amount it will pay. This limit is called the \"recognized\" or \"allowed\"\namount.\nThe members' doctor sets his or her own rate to charge members. These rates may be higher -- sometimes much higher -- than\nwhat the members' Aetna plan \"recognizes.\" Members' doctors may bill them for the dollar amount that their plan doesn't\n\"recognize.\" Members must also pay any copayments, coinsurance and deductibles under their plan. No dollar amount above the\n\"recognized charge\" counts toward their deductible or out-of-pocket maximums. To learn more about how we pay out-of-network\nbenefits visit Aetna.com. Type \"how Aetna pays\" in the search box.\nMembers can avoid these extra costs by getting their care from Aetna's network of health care providers. Go to www.aetna.com\nand click on \"Find a Doctor\" on the left side of the page. Members can sign on to the Aetna member site.\nThis applies when members choose to get care out of network. When members have no choice (for example: emergency room\nvisit after a car accident, or for other emergency services), we will pay the bill as if the member got care in network. Members pay\ncost sharing and deductibles for their in-network level of benefits. Members should contact Aetna if their health care provider asks\nthem to pay more. Members are not responsible for any outstanding balance billed by their providers for emergency services\nbeyond their cost sharing and deductibles.\nWhat's Not Covered\nThis plan does not cover all health care expenses and includes exclusions and limitations.  Members should refer to their plan\ndocuments to determine which health care services are covered and to what extent.  The following is a partial list of services and\nsupplies that are generally not covered.
